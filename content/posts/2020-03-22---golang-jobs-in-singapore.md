Hi! I'm developing a micro-site built with React and Ant Design to aggregate/curate Golang Developer or Engineer jobs here in Singapore. I also used Go for the data gathering.

The site has Golang Developer or Engineer roles and also Go-related jobs like Software Engineering Manager roles, DevOps, Site Reliability Engineers, Data Engineers, which require Go knowledge or experience. Job posts are from different job sites here in Singapore. The site only shows titles and summaries of the job openings and will always link to the original job post where you can apply or send your resume to. The purpose of the site is to have one place to search for a Go developer role. This has been a challenge for me before and I thought that this is something which will be useful to those looking for Go-related jobs here in Singapore.

So far, the site has job postings from Indeed, LinkedIn and JobsDB, the more popular job websites here. I'll be adding more when I have time.  Hope it is useful to those looking for golang work here in Singapore. I haven't bought a domain and do proper styling though and 

I'm still finalizing some ideas on how to proceed with it. Any feedback or ideas are greatly appreciated. 

Check it out here! https://golang-jobs.now.sh/

You can bookmark this blog post since I might change the link to a proper domain.  Would love to know if it helps! 

Cheers!
