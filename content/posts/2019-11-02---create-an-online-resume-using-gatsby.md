I developed a gatsby starter to create an online resume. I  used Material UI for the theming.
Check the Demo https://donvito-gatsby-resume-starter.netlify.com

ðŸš€ Quick start

1. Download the starter code from the repo below.
https://github.com/donvito/donvito-gatsby-resume-starter

2. Add the data to be populated for your resume. 
Edit the following files:

src/data/summary.json: This data file is used to populate the Summary section.
src/data/contact.json: This data file is used to populate the Contact section.
src/data/experience.json: This data file is used to populate the Experience section.
src/data/skill.json: This data file is used to populate the Skills section.

3. Start the site. Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

4. Access the site!Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000!


Note: You'll also see a second link: http://localhost:8000/___graphql. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. 

Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).

Open the donvito-gatsby-resume-starter directory in your code editor of choice and edit src/pages/index.js. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
