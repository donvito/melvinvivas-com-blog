A few months back, I started my journey to learning Golang. I started with Tour of Go, watched videos of Todd McLeod in Youtube, and tried out examples I find in the web. I thought of sharing all these learning to anyone who wanted to learn Golang so I blogged about it here.

I only learn Go during my spare time, mostly during the weekends if we don't have any deployment or support activity at work. At some point, I felt this void and knew something was missing. Since most of my colleagues and friends were not into Go yet, I didn't have anyone to share and discuss my ideas. This was the same feeling I had around 15 years ago when I was starting with Java. During that time, the Philippine Java community was not active so I started PinoyJUG - a community of Filipino developers who wanted to be good at Java.

Internally, I figured that I had to do something about this feeling I had! So, I searched if I can find any community which I can share my ideas and learnings and hopefully learn from developers who are already adept with programming in Go. Not sure if it was a coincidence but my friend told me that GopherCon Singapore 2018 was coming up. I wanted to volunteer and help. Thankfully, my friend [Eman](https://twitter.com/emanpatricio), was part of the organizers and introduced me to the group. So I joined the next all-hands(meeting of organizers to plan for the event) when I was free. First all-hands was alright, I volunteered to help in the workshops even though I didn't know what to do to help out - ha ha! Anyway, they informed me that help was required on workshop days itself. It was good, I was excited!

[GopherCon Singapore 2018](https://2018.gophercon.sg/) had a few activities. 2-day workshops on May 2 to 3 and on May 4, it was the conference day.

Speaker for the 2-day workshops was [Bill Kennedy](https://twitter.com/goinggodotnet) of Ardan Labs. He did a workshop for beginners "Go Fundamentals" and "Ultimate Go" for advanced Go developers. Bill was really good and he really spent time in explaining how to do things right with Go. Since Go is natively compiled, he also spent time explaining low level topics like CPU caches. In "Go Fundamentals", he spent significant time in explaining value and pointer semantics which I believe is essential to know especially for those who are using programming languages which do not have pointers. He shared so many information and I'm sure, like me, other attendees are overwhelmed. All information he discussed are in his github repo.

[Conference Day - 4th May]
Our speakers for this year's conference were from Google, Github, GoJek, SP Digital, WeWork, Heroic Labs, Ordermentum, and Loom Networks.

We started the conference with [Sau Sheong](https://twitter.com/sausheong)'s [welcome address](https://engineers.sg/video/opening-address-gopherconsg-2018--2602). He shared interesting insights about last year's GopherCon. Last year, there were around 100 attendees and this year it was tripled - 300+ attendees! This definitely shows the increasing popularity of Go in the software development scene.
